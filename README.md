# sentence_word2vec
word2vec with a context based on sentences, in C++.

This is based on the tensorflow implementation of word2vec.

However, the context for the model is defined differently:

* the context for the model is defined in terms of sentences.
* the context for a given word is the rest of words in a sentence.

This is implemented in C++ in the `sentence_word2vec_kernels.cc` file.

Why might this be useful? This can be used to model playlists or
user histories for recommendation! Or any other kind of 'bagged' data.

## Usage

To compile the C++ ops used:
```
git clone https://github.com/altosaar/sentence_word2vec
cd sentence_word2vec
./compile_ops.sh
```

To get the text8 data and split it into sentences for testing:
```
./get_data.sh
```

To run the code with a sentence-level context window:
```
python word2vec_optimized.py -- \
    --train_data text8_split \
    --eval_data questions-words.txt \
    --save_path /tmp \
    --sentence_level True
```

On a Macbook Air with the following config, the speed is around 17k words/second. This is up from around 2k words/second with a [manual python implementation](https://github.com/altosaar/scirec).

This directory contains models for unsupervised training of word embeddings
using the model described in:
(Mikolov, et. al.) [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781),
ICLR 2013.

Detailed instructions and description of this model is available in the
tensorflow tutorials:
